This repository contains two Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models developed to solve different classification problems:

Heart Disease Prediction Model: Predicts the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on various medical parameters.
Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model: Predicts whether a bank customer is likely to exit the bank (churn) based on customer demographics and account information.
